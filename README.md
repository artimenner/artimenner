- ğŸ“¢ Greetings, I'm @artimenner I'm a Penetration Tester. I plan to share the knowledge I have experienced on Github and the software I have created over time.
- ğŸ“š What do I know? I am familiar with what a penetration tester knows and general abilities. I am open to learning, and I have a lot of fun while learning.
